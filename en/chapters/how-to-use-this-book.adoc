== How to Use This Book

This book is both a *reference* and a *journey*.  
You can read it cover-to-cover or jump directly to the sections that matter most to your work.

We’ve designed it with multiple entry points, so whether you are brand-new to messaging or a seasoned architect managing a multi-broker fleet, you’ll find value.

=== Reading Paths by Experience Tier

We’ve tagged content for different levels of experience.  
If you identify your tier, you can follow the recommended path:

- **Beginner (0–2 years)**  
  Start with Part I: *Messaging Fundamentals* (Chapters 1–3).  
  These chapters introduce core concepts and get you hands-on with OmniQueue quickly.  
  Then, read only the broker chapters (Part II) for the systems you’ll use in your current work.

- **Intermediate (2–5 years)**  
  You can skim Part I for a refresher, then dive deep into the broker chapters (Part II).  
  Pay attention to *War Stories* and *Cheat Sheets* — they’ll save you pain in production.  
  Follow with Part III to learn scaling, monitoring, and advanced OmniQueue patterns.

- **Senior Engineer / Architect (5+ years)**  
  Jump to the broker chapters you care about most, but don’t skip Part III — it’s packed with operational patterns for high-scale environments.  
  Use Part IV’s case studies for inspiration and validation of architectural decisions.

- **OmniQueue Mastery Mode**  
  These sections are sprinkled throughout the book for readers who want to extend OmniQueue itself.  
  You’ll find them in both broker chapters and advanced sections.

=== Part-by-Part Guide

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===
| Part | How to Use It
| I | Foundation for messaging concepts and OmniQueue basics. Best for new readers.
| II | Broker-specific knowledge. Each chapter is standalone — read only what you need.
| III | Advanced OmniQueue usage: scaling, observability, disaster recovery.
| IV | Real-world case studies — learn from actual deployments and failures.
| V | Contribution and extension — for those building on or contributing to OmniQueue.
| Appendices | Quick-reference materials, glossary, and operational checklists.

=== Code Examples

All OmniQueue examples are in **TypeScript**.  
We assume you have basic familiarity with `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn` and Node.js tooling.

Code listings are annotated with comments to explain *why* something is done, not just *how*.  
For example:

[source, typescript]
----
// Sending a message with OmniQueue
await omni.send({
  destination: 'orders',
  body: { id: '1234', status: 'confirmed' },
  group: 'order-processing', // Required for consumers
  ensure: true, // Create destination if it doesn't exist
});
----

Whenever we compare OmniQueue to a native broker API, we show them side-by-side for clarity.

=== Diagrams and Visuals

We use **Mermaid diagrams** for flows, topologies, and message lifecycles.
These are rendered in the book, but if you’re reading the raw AsciiDoc, you can copy the code into any Mermaid-compatible renderer to visualize it.

=== Cheat Sheets and War Stories

At the end of each broker chapter:

* **Cheat Sheet** — quick reference for commands, configs, metrics, and a *disaster checklist*.
* **War Stories** — short narratives of real-world incidents, failures, and their solutions.

=== Cross-References

Throughout the book, cross-references (e.g., “see <<\_chapter\_3>>”) help you connect concepts.
We strongly encourage following them, especially when exploring advanced topics that build on earlier material.

=== What You’ll Need

- **Node.js** 18+
- A package manager (`npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`)
- Docker (optional, but useful for running brokers locally)
- Basic terminal familiarity

You don’t need to install every broker at once — we’ll give setup instructions per chapter.

=== Our Advice

- **Don’t just read — run the examples.**
  Messaging is best learned by sending and receiving real messages.

- **Experiment with failure.**
  Kill brokers, drop connections, overload queues — see how systems behave under stress.

- **Adapt patterns to your context.**
  There’s no universal “right” way; use these patterns as starting points.
